This is the first post for this blog.

I don't have much to say, but I'm pretty psyched that I can `git push` my
words to the whole web now. 

I'll probably forget about this, and let it languish like all my other
projects, but if I don't, these are some topics I want to hit this week:

- Notes on the OpenShift pre-req course for my Openshift Developer enablement
  next week.
- Progress on a Hunt The Wumpus game powered by jBPM and Drools with
  enhancements like
    - spring-boot server
    - binary compilation with quarkus
    - entando front end 

I've never tech blogged, but I hope I can keep this going. The Hunt The
Wumpus should be good material for a tech talk and a few Mojo community docs
