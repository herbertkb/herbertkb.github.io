# Fix Anterior Pelvic Tilt

Notes from Jeremy Ethier's video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NZMaI-HeNU

## Causes

- weak abdominals and glutes
- tight hip flexors and erector spinae

## Posterior Pelvic Tilt

1. Lie on back, knees up.
2. If anterior pelvic tilt, your lower back is far off the ground.
3. Flatten your lower back to touch ground along entire spine.
4. Go back and forth between positions 10 reps. 
5. Stand and do the same for 10 more reps.

## Strengthen Glutes and Abs

#### Glute bridges

- Back on floor, knees up.
- Raise hips. Do not round back, belly button should stay below crotch
- Straight line along crotch and back.
- Add weights over time for better development

#### RKC Planks

- planks because other ab exercises use hip flexors, which are already tight
- Assume normal plank with hands locked and feet should width apart.
- Draw belly button towards spine.
- Posterior pelvic tilt. Hold as long as possible without arching back.
- repeat once


## Stretch Hip Flexors

### Lunge Stretch

- lunge position with both knees at 90 degrees, toes back.
- lean forward with PPT
- ten deep breathes. may turn torso for deeper stretch
- repeat with other side.

### Rectus Femoris Stretch

- Lunge with one knee down, foot against butt. 
- lean against bench or lean against something and hold foot with hand
- ten deep breaths
- repeat with other side.


## Routine 
 
- Lying pelvic tilt: 1x10
- Standing pelvic tilt: 1x10
- hip thrust: 3x10+
- RKC plank: 2xMaxHoldTime
- lunge stretch: each leg 30 secs/10 breaths
- rectus femoris stretch: each leg 30 secs/10 breaths
